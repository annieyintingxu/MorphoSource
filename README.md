The files in the MorphoSource repository were originally created in 2021, to communicate the work of a 3-person data science consultant team to the permanent software team that maintains and updates the MorphoSource database. We wrote up guides that would allow the software team to recreate the work that we did and implement it in full on the morphosource.org website. I worked closely with Zoe Zhu, Liuren Yin, and was advised by Jocelyn Triplett, Dr. Julie Winchester, and Dr. Doug Boyer, all of Duke University.

The following are Jupyter guide notebooks outlining how to obtain values like the total number of page views using Google Analytics and how to generate basic plots that can inform scientists about their peers' usage of digitzed fossils and other archaeological objects. \
