The files in the MorphoSource repository were originally created in 2021, to communicate the work of a 3-person data science consultant team to the permanent software team that maintains and updates the MorphoSource database. We wrote up guides that would allow the software team to recreate the work that we did and implement it in full on the morphosource.org website. I worked closely with Zoe Zhu and Liuren Yin, and was advised by Jocelyn Triplett, Dr. Julie Winchester, and Dr. Doug Boyer. All are affiliated with Duke University other than me, an undergraduate at Rice University.

The following are Jupyter notebooks outlining the methods for obtaining statistics like the total number of page views and methods to generate basic plots that quantify usage of digitzed fossils and other archaeological objects. \
